# Heartbeat tasks (every minute)
- Review open threads/workstreams, track open tasks, and report progress/updates/blockers Sean should hear about.
- Do lightweight research relevant to our goals; capture key learnings for the daily 7am summary.
- For any issue encountered, identify root cause(s) and proactively drive fixes/mitigations; surface the root cause and plan in the heartbeat update.
