# 2026-02-12 — Daily Log

## Boot Check (3:51 PM ET)
- Gateway v2026.2.9 online
- All LLM endpoints healthy (11437, 11439, 8080)
- systemd units inactive but services running (same as yesterday)
- Model: claude-opus-4-6, subagent primary: a3b (qwen3-coder-30b)
- Slack connected, config valid
- Continuing from yesterday's context (compacted session)

## Execution Crisis (3:56-4:16 PM ET) — ONGOING
- **Issue**: a3b model server (11438) accepts health checks & /v1/models but fails inference (empty response or 503)
- **Impact**: ALL subagent spawns fail (dev, dev-cloud, orchestrator all route to a3b), work-executor cron failing, infra crons failing
- **Root cause discovered**: `dev` and `dev-cloud` agents aren't configured in openclaw.json (listed in allowAgents but no config entry). Even `orchestrator` (configured with Sonnet) gets overridden to a3b by subagent default model.
- **Additional findings**: GLM server (11436) completely down, lockn-whisper-gpu unhealthy 3+ hours
- **Actions**: 3 subagent spawns attempted (dev, dev-cloud, orchestrator) — all failed
- **Status**: Need a3b restart or subagent model routing fix  
- **Heartbeat action (4:20 PM)**: Spawned ux-lead on LOC-85 (top priority unblocked ticket, UX/UI Overhaul project). UX-Lead uses Codex primary, bypassing A3B — testing if this works.

## Recovery Status (4:36 PM ET)
- **Anti-idle rule**: ✅ Not triggered (3 tickets completed in last 2h: LOC-334, LOC-459, LOC-460)
- **Orphan issues**: ✅ Fixed (assigned LOC-401 & LOC-398 to UX/UI Overhaul project)
- **Staleness**: All In Progress items <48h old (no flags needed)
- **Work automation**: Partially recovered, some subagents working despite A3B issues
