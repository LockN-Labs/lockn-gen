## Heartbeat 23:31 - Parallel Pipeline Execution

**Context Health:** ✅ Healthy (0/200K tokens, fresh session)

**Actions Taken:**
- Started coding pipeline for LOC-175 (Security Audit Automation) - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 architecture design by dev-cloud agent
- Started coding pipeline for LOC-176 (Background Codebase Analysis) - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 architecture design by dev-cloud agent  
- Spawned value audit agent (research-local) for interval analysis
- Posted value score 8.20/10 to #system-heartbeat

**Active Sub-Agents:**
- 2× dev-cloud agents (Codex) - Architecture design for LOC-175 + LOC-176
- 1× research-local agent (Qwen3-32B) - Value audit
- 3× background model tasks: VL visual QA, Coder-Next implementation, Qwen3-32B code review

**System Status:**
- Infrastructure: All healthy (23:28 check - disk 42%, mem 64% avail)  
- Both Todo tickets converted to In Progress with full requirements defined
- Parallel execution maximized across all available models
- No blockers identified

**Next Interval Goals:**
- Harvest Phase 2 architecture outputs from LOC-175/176
- Dispatch Phase 3 implementation to Coder-Next (:11439)  
- Monitor and merge any completed PRs

## Previous Heartbeat Entry (23:16)

**Context Health:** ✅ Healthy (0/200K tokens, 0% usage)

**Active Subagents:**
- Value audit agent (research-local) - System interval delta analysis
- LOC-176 dev agent - Background codebase analysis automation  
- LOC-175 devops-cloud agent - Security audit automation (Trivy + deps)

**Linear Todo Items Processed:**
- LOC-176: Background Codebase Analysis — Nightly Architecture Review via CPU Coder-Next
  - Status: Kicked off via dev agent
  - Goal: Automated nightly architecture reviews using 2M context CPU Coder-Next
- LOC-175: Security Audit Automation — Automated Trivy + dependency scanning  
  - Status: Kicked off via devops-cloud agent
  - Goal: Nightly security scans with automatic issue creation

**Value Generation:**
- Autonomous ticket progression without manual intervention
- Multiple agent workflows running in parallel
- Both local and cloud compute fully utilized

**Infrastructure Status:**
- All local models healthy and responsive
- GitHub integration operational
- No permission blockers for current work

**Next Actions:**
- Monitor Phase 2 completion for both tickets
- Prepare Phase 3 implementation dispatch
- Continue autonomous pipeline execution

## Naming Corrections (from Sean, 23:45 EST)
- **LockN Auth** — correct name for the authentication/API keys service. NOT "API Keys" or "LockN API Keys"
- All references in code, health checks, docs, and reports must use "LockN Auth"
- Repo: `lockn-auth`

## Model Tracking Update (23:36 EST)
- Kimi K2.5 (via Ollama cloud proxy) added to value report tracking
- Ollama hosts both local models (qwen3-embedding) and cloud proxies (gemini-3-pro, deepseek-v3.2, kimi-k2.5)
- All contributing models must appear in value reports — no invisible work
