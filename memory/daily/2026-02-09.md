# Daily Memory - February 9, 2026

## Key Events

### MCP Integration Live
- **Linear MCP:** 32 tools via `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`, HTTP transport, Bearer auth
- **Notion MCP:** 22 tools via local `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server`, stdio transport
- Plugin: `openclaw-mcp-adapter` v0.1.1 (MIT, 219 LOC)

### GitHub App Bot Infrastructure Complete
- 5 GitHub Apps created and installed on LockN-Labs org:
  - lockn-architect (2816706), lockn-coder (2816646), lockn-devops (2816768)
  - lockn-orchestrator (2816797) — PRIMARY for reviews/merges
  - lockn-qa (2816677)
- Auth flow: JWT (RS256) → installation token (1hr expiry)
- Scripts at: /home/sean/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/github-app-auth.js

### Sandbox Security Model Decision
- ≤32B models: sandbox enabled, web denied
- 80B+ models: sandbox off, web allowed
- Cloud models: sandbox off, web allowed
- `elevated: true` on exec() works for system config edits

### HTTPS Roadmap Complete (LOC-286)
- All 4 subtasks done (LOC-319 URL audit, LOC-320 CF verification, LOC-321 smoke tests, HSTS headers)
- HSTS + nosniff headers live on lockn.ai via Cloudflare API
- Key lesson: CF API token was in .env — automatability was 9/10 not 3/10

### LOC-270 Waitlist Activation Engine COMPLETE
- All 5 subtasks done in one heartbeat cycle (LOC-313 through LOC-317)
- lockn-auth now has: API keys, Auth0, waitlist, drip emails, invite tokens, email templates, dashboard analytics
- PRs #6-#9 merged on lockn-auth

### XRPL Trading Initiative (LOC-323)
- New project: LockN Swap + Swing — XRPL atomic arbitrage + ML swing trading
- 10 subtasks created (LOC-325 through LOC-334)
- LOC-325 (XRPL WebSocket client) implementation blocked by sandbox issues

### Orchestrate-Local vs Orchestrate-Cloud Design
- Sean interested in Coder-Next (1M context, $0) as primary orchestrator
- Key insight: "Pull model" — cloud subagents request context from local orchestrator via sessions_send
- Cloud models work as specialists with bounded tasks, local model holds full project state
- Existing compute-priority skill needs enhancement to support this

### Sean's Naming Correction (from 2026-02-07, reinforced)
- **LockN Auth** — correct name. NOT "API Keys" or "LockN API Keys"

### Critical: NO OFF-HOURS Violation (21:31 EST)
- Sean caught heartbeat cron saying "winding down", "quiet evening", "not auto-starting without Sean's prioritization"
- Sean reacted 😡 — this directly violates 24/7 mandate
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with absolute rule at top: NO OFF-HOURS, NO WINDING DOWN
- Dispatched 3 subagents immediately to fix idle pipeline (PR #12 conflicts, LOC-340, LOC-309)

### Model Tracking Update
- Kimi K2.5 (Ollama cloud proxy) added to value reports
- All Ollama cloud proxies tracked: gemini-3-pro, deepseek-v3.2, kimi-k2.5
- Value reports must reflect ALL contributing models — no invisible work

### Top 5 Priorities (as of 1:20 PM)
1. LOC-256: Stripe Checkout + Webhook Entitlements (P0, revenue gate)
2. LOC-257: Public Demo/Trial Flow (P1, conversion funnel)
3. LOC-271: Paid Onboarding Wizard (P1, full conversion path)
4. LOC-286: HTTPS ✅ DONE
5. LOC-85: Web UI Enhancement (P1, storefront)

### Active Subagents at Session End
- PR #12 conflict resolution (lockn-score)
- LOC-340 search quality benchmark (P0 Urgent)
- LOC-309 Stripe self-serve checkout (P1 revenue)

### Linear Backlog State
- 15+ Todo tickets, mostly revenue-critical (LOC-302 through LOC-348)
- Foundation work (LOC-255 landing, LOC-256 Stripe, LOC-270 waitlist) largely complete
- Revenue pipeline ready to unblock

### Autonomous Product Management Framework (21:45 EST)
- **Trigger:** Sean said "this should never become an issue again" re: idle pipeline waiting on prioritization
- **Created:** `skills/product-management/SKILL.md` — full PM framework with RICE scoring, decision authority matrix, escalation triggers
- **CPO Weekly Review cron:** Every Monday 6AM ET, spawns CPO agent on Kimi to rebalance portfolio
- **HEARTBEAT.md updated:** PM scoring now mandatory every heartbeat
- **Initial scoring:** 28 Todo tickets scored, 3 priority lanes identified
  - Lane 1: LOC-309 Stripe Checkout (7.7) → Revenue pipeline
  - Lane 2: LOC-325 XRPL WebSocket (7.3) → Trading revenue  
  - Lane 3: LOC-335 Chunking (5.6) → Infra quick win
- **Duplicate found:** LOC-346 marked as dup of LOC-304 (both Stripe dunning)
- **LOC-348** moved to Backlog (needs data/deps before it's useful)
- **LOC-309, LOC-335** moved to In Progress

### UX Agent System Initiative (23:22 EST)
- **Sean directive:** Build full UX agent team with Figma integration, recurring audits, and design-to-code pipeline
- **Figma Pro added:** $20/month Professional plan
- **Research crew deployed:** Opus (architecture ✅), DeepSeek (scoring rubric), Kimi (MCP research - errored)
- **Architecture doc:** `docs/ux-agent-system-architecture.md` — 4-layer system (Design→Orchestration→Action→Verification)
- **8 Linear tickets created:** LOC-389 through LOC-396
  - LOC-389: Wire Figma MCP into OpenClaw adapter (Urgent)
  - LOC-390: UX-lead agent config (Urgent)
  - LOC-391: UX-vision-cloud agent
  - LOC-392: UX-vision-local agent
  - LOC-393-396: Four UX skills (kickoff, regression, overhaul, walkthrough)
- **Three agents defined:**
  - UX-lead (Codex) — orchestrator, controls Figma MCP + Playwright + Linear
  - UX-vision-cloud (Qwen3-VL 235B Ollama) — deep visual analysis
  - UX-vision-local (Qwen3-VL 8B local) — fast/free screenshot QA
- **Investor demo tomorrow** — 3 quick wins planned (Figma mockup, visual regression demo, UX scorecard)
- **Blocker:** Figma API token needed from Sean to wire MCP
