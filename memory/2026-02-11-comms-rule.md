# 2026-02-11 Communication Rule - BURNED IN

## ⛔ NEVER USE DM THREAD

Sean explicitly called this out (again) on 2026-02-11 18:40 EST. He was frustrated this keeps happening.

### The Rule:
1. **NO DM thread** — NEVER use D0AC46HCRNZ for comms
2. Route ALL messages through the appropriate Slack **channel**
3. If no appropriate channel exists → suggest creation in **#process-improvements** (C0ADGH08ZD1)

This is already in AGENTS.md rule #8 but was still being violated. No excuses.
