# 2026-02-01

- Updated Ollama, created system-wide alias for `clawdbot`, and symlinked `/usr/local/bin/clawdbot` to OpenClaw binary.
- Configured OpenClaw to use Ollama model `kimi-k2.5:cloud` as primary; encountered 404 from model.
- Enabled gateway `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint for testing and verified it returns "Hi 7" via curl.
- Sean concluded we may not be using Ollama cloud models with OpenClaw yet (as of this test).
- Wired Ollama `qwen3-embedding:latest` via OpenAI-compatible endpoint for memorySearch (baseUrl: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1) and rebuilt vector store.
- Sean set initial goal: $500/month ramp-up revenue; enablers focus on local multimodal models and system improvements (incl. OrchestraSean).
