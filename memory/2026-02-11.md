# 2026-02-11 Daily Log

## Key Events
- **LOC-412 created**: "Clean up CI/CD pipeline for production deployment" — Sean requested in #system-heartbeat, High priority
- **PR #12 lockn-score**: Merge conflicts resolved (19 regions across session.py + Home.tsx), now mergeable pending review approval
- **PR #10 lockn-auth**: Stripe checkout + webhook + plan gating landed (LOC-256 — #1 revenue blocker unblocked). Tiers: Starter $9, Builder $29, Team $79
- **PR #9 lockn-sense**: Search quality benchmark suite (LOC-340) complete. Baseline: nDCG@5=0.983, MRR=0.958
- **Gateway restart loop**: 9 restarts in ~42 min (19:12-19:54 ET). Root cause: Coder-Next SIGABRT crash-loop caused cascading LLM timeouts in cron jobs. Resolved itself when Coder-Next recovered. VRAM dropped 98.3% → 83.5%.

## Sean Directive — BURNED TO MEMORY
- **"Never tell Sean to investigate anything"** — Always dispatch to appropriate subagent autonomously. Sean is CEO, sets priorities. Agents execute. No "please check X" or "recommend you run Y". Just do it. (triggered by boot check telling Sean to run journalctl)
- Added to MEMORY.md under Sean preferences section

## A3B Subagent Limitation
- A3B (qwen3-coder-30b-a3b) cannot reliably execute tool calls — uses wrong format (`<function=exec>` instead of proper XML). Subagent tasks requiring tool execution should use Sonnet or Coder-Next fallback, not A3B alone.

## Infrastructure Status (end of day)
- Gateway stable since ~20:02 ET
- A3B recovered from timeout issues
- Qwen3-32B and Coder-Next intermittently degraded
- 8 agent configs missing (dev/devops/research/reasoning variants)
- Figma Bridge port 9223 conflict
- Cron scheduler timing out (10s) — not restarting per anti-loop policy

## LockN AI — .NET Aspire Decision + Technical Planning (20:58-21:06 EST)
- Sean confirmed .NET for abstractions, specifically **.NET Aspire** as orchestration framework
- Two deep research sessions completed:
  - **Opus**: Full Aspire architecture doc → `research/lockn-ai-aspire-architecture.md`
    - 9 C# provider interfaces (ILocknChat, ILocknAuth, ILocknWork, etc.)
    - AppHost wiring, service discovery, OTel, NuGet packaging (18+ packages)
  - **Codex**: Implementation gameplan → `research/lockn-ai-implementation-gameplan.md`
    - Phase 0 (2-3w): Aspire scaffold + abstractions
    - Phase 1 (4-6w): Wrap current stack behind interfaces
    - Phase 2 (4-8w): First OSS module (recommends Plane/LockN Work)
    - Phase 3 (4-6mo): Full owned stack
    - Recommends LockN Work (Plane) as first OSS migration target
- Both docs ready for product team handoff
- Key tech decisions: gRPC internal, REST for OpenClaw, Redis Streams event bus, config-driven provider swapping
