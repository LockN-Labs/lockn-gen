## Sean Directive: QA Proactivity (burned into MEMORY.md)
- Sean explicitly said: **Don't ask the CEO whether to continue proactive testing. Just do it.**

## Sean Directive: Continuous Improvement Protocol
- When a lesson is learned, burn it into memory immediately.
- Assess systemic improvements, post recommendations to #strategy.

## QA Confidence Audit
- Full-stack audit: composite score 5.90/10.00
- Passing: lockn-score (68), lockn-swap (7), lockn-apikeys (11), lockn-speak (17), lockn-logger (128), qa-agent Playwright (4)
- Failing: lockn-listen (build broken), lockn-gen (permission errors)
- Top gaps: no Ship tests, Listen build-broken, Gen perms, sparse E2E, payment unvalidated

## MEMORY.md Disappearance — Root Cause
- MEMORY.md was tracked on `master` but never committed to `main` (new default branch).
- Lived as untracked file on disk, lost during branch operations.
- A subagent's temp_backup at ~2:03 PM saved us.
- Fix: committed all workspace state files to `main`.
- Lesson: workspace state files MUST be git-tracked. Untracked = fragile.
