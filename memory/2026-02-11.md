## Sean Directive: QA Proactivity (burned into MEMORY.md)
- Sean explicitly said: **Don't ask the CEO whether to continue proactive testing. Just do it.**
- Added permanent QA Policy section to MEMORY.md.

## QA Confidence Audit - Full Results
Ran autonomous full-stack QA confidence audit across all available LockN repos.

### Passing
- `lockn-score`: 68 passed, 3 skipped (pytest)
- `lockn-swap`: 7 passed (dotnet)
- `lockn-apikeys`: 11 passed (dotnet)
- `lockn-speak/chatterbox`: 17 passed (pytest)
- `lockn-logger`: 128 passed (dotnet)
- `lockn-infra/qa-agent`: 4/4 Playwright smoke tests passed

### Failing/Blocked
- `lockn-listen`: build failure (OpenApiOperation ref + Span across await)
- `lockn-gen`: permission errors (root-owned obj dirs)
- `lockn-speak` .NET: no tests discovered from solution root

### Overall Composite Confidence: 5.90/10.00

### Top Gaps
1. No Ship product tests/repo in workspace
2. Listen API build-broken
3. Gen tests blocked by filesystem perms
4. Sparse browser E2E for onboarding/auth/payment
5. Payment flow unvalidated
