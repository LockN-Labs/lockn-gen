## Sean Directive: QA Proactivity (burned into MEMORY.md)
- Sean explicitly said: **Don't ask the CEO whether to continue proactive testing. Just do it.**

## Sean Directive: Continuous Improvement Protocol
- When a lesson is learned, burn it into memory immediately.
- Assess systemic improvements, post recommendations to #strategy.

## QA Confidence Audit
- Full-stack audit: composite score 5.90/10.00
- Passing: lockn-score (68), lockn-swap (7), lockn-apikeys (11), lockn-speak (17), lockn-logger (128), qa-agent Playwright (4)
- Failing: lockn-listen (build broken), lockn-gen (permission errors)
- Top gaps: no Ship tests, Listen build-broken, Gen perms, sparse E2E, payment unvalidated

## MEMORY.md Disappearance — Root Cause
- MEMORY.md was tracked on `master` but never committed to `main` (new default branch).
- Lived as untracked file on disk, lost during branch operations.
- A subagent's temp_backup at ~2:03 PM saved us.
- Fix: committed all workspace state files to `main`.
- Lesson: workspace state files MUST be git-tracked. Untracked = fragile.

## Slack Rules Retrofit (Option A) — ~6:50 PM
- Sean chose Option A (shared rules file) over gateway feature request or cron prompt propagation
- Created `docs/standards/slack-rules.md` — single source of truth for all Slack comms rules
- Each cron prompt gets one-liner: "Read and follow slack-rules.md before any Slack output"
- Updated 8/20 cron jobs before gateway saturation: devops-infra, idle-watchdog, priority-dispatcher, work-executor, linear-priority-monitor, revenue-triage, gpu-monitor, docs-review
- Remaining ~12 jobs still need the preamble added

## Gateway Restart Loop — Root Cause & Fix (~7-8 PM)
- HEARTBEAT.md had rule: "if cron times out, restart gateway"
- This created a loop: restart → overdue jobs flood → timeout → heartbeat restarts again
- Fixed HEARTBEAT.md: cron timeout now triggers ALERT not RESTART
- Second cron backlog storm today (first was the 23-job storm after 8h reboot)
- **Lesson**: Never auto-restart on cron timeout. Overdue job catch-up is the #1 gateway stability risk.

## LOCKN-421 Shipped (Revenue Critical)
- Auth0-to-Waitlist-to-Checkout bridge — PR #38
- Full bridge endpoint, deterministic routing states, transition guards, telemetry, 4 tests
- LOCKN-441 (Stripe checkout) now unblocked

## Meta-Prompting Research Complete
- `docs/research/sean-system-improvement-instructions-examples.txt` — raw examples from Slack
- `docs/research/sean-generalized-meta-prompt-patterns-opus.txt` — Opus-generalized patterns
