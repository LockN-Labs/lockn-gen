## Sean Directive: QA Proactivity (burned into MEMORY.md)
- Sean explicitly said: **Don't ask the CEO whether to continue proactive testing. Just do it.**

## Sean Directive: Continuous Improvement Protocol
- When a lesson is learned, burn it into memory immediately.
- Assess systemic improvements, post recommendations to #strategy.

## QA Confidence Audit
- Full-stack audit: composite score 5.90/10.00
- Passing: lockn-score (68), lockn-swap (7), lockn-apikeys (11), lockn-speak (17), lockn-logger (128), qa-agent Playwright (4)
- Failing: lockn-listen (build broken), lockn-gen (permission errors)
- Top gaps: no Ship tests, Listen build-broken, Gen perms, sparse E2E, payment unvalidated

## MEMORY.md Disappearance — Root Cause
- MEMORY.md was tracked on `master` but never committed to `main` (new default branch).
- Lived as untracked file on disk, lost during branch operations.
- A subagent's temp_backup at ~2:03 PM saved us.
- Fix: committed all workspace state files to `main`.
- Lesson: workspace state files MUST be git-tracked. Untracked = fragile.

## Slack Rules Retrofit (Option A) — ~6:50 PM
- Sean chose Option A (shared rules file) over gateway feature request or cron prompt propagation
- Created `docs/standards/slack-rules.md` — single source of truth for all Slack comms rules
- Each cron prompt gets one-liner: "Read and follow slack-rules.md before any Slack output"
- Updated 8/20 cron jobs before gateway saturation: devops-infra, idle-watchdog, priority-dispatcher, work-executor, linear-priority-monitor, revenue-triage, gpu-monitor, docs-review
- Remaining ~12 jobs still need the preamble added

## Gateway Restart Loop — Root Cause & Fix (~7-8 PM)
- HEARTBEAT.md had rule: "if cron times out, restart gateway"
- This created a loop: restart → overdue jobs flood → timeout → heartbeat restarts again
- Fixed HEARTBEAT.md: cron timeout now triggers ALERT not RESTART
- Second cron backlog storm today (first was the 23-job storm after 8h reboot)
- **Lesson**: Never auto-restart on cron timeout. Overdue job catch-up is the #1 gateway stability risk.

## LOCKN-421 Shipped (Revenue Critical)
- Auth0-to-Waitlist-to-Checkout bridge — PR #38
- Full bridge endpoint, deterministic routing states, transition guards, telemetry, 4 tests
- LOCKN-441 (Stripe checkout) now unblocked

## Meta-Prompting Research Complete
- `docs/research/sean-system-improvement-instructions-examples.txt` — raw examples from Slack
- `docs/research/sean-generalized-meta-prompt-patterns-opus.txt` — Opus-generalized patterns

## Agentic OS Research (18:22-20:30 EST)
- Sean asked about n8n + architecture diagramming → expanded to full productizable agentic OS vision
- **4 research agents dispatched**: Opus (comms), Codex (auth), Kimi (PM/KB), DeepSeek (synthesis)
  - DeepSeek and Kimi both failed (produced no output). Compiled manually.
- **Reports saved:**
  - `research/system-layers-research.md` — Temporal + D2 recommendation
  - `research/comms-layer-research.md` — Matrix protocol deep dive
  - `research/auth-identity-research.md` — Zitadel recommendation
  - `research/agentic-os-unified-report.md` — Full unified synthesis
- **Full agentic OS stack recommendation:**
  - Runtime: OpenClaw (proprietary, core product)
  - Orchestration: Temporal (MIT)
  - Comms: Matrix protocol + custom client (Apache 2.0) — NOBODY else in agentic space owns comms
  - Auth: Zitadel (Apache 2.0) — multi-tenant, event-sourced, Auth0 migration path
  - PM: Plane (AGPL + commercial license available)
  - KB: AFFiNE (MIT) — local-first, block editor + whiteboard
  - Observability: OTel + Grafana (Apache + AGPL)
  - Diagrams: D2 + Mermaid (MPL + MIT)
  - Vector DB: Qdrant (Apache 2.0, already deployed)
- **Strategic insight**: No competitor owns the full stack. All parasitize SaaS or are frameworks-only.
- **Implementation approach**: Abstraction-first (provider interfaces for each layer), then swap in owned modules incrementally
- **n8n rejected** for product use — Sustainable Use License blocks embedding/resale
- Sean's reaction to unified report pending

## LockN AI — Agentic Interface (20:56 EST, Sean directive)
- Sean named the full agentic OS: **LockN AI (Agentic Interface)**
- Module map confirmed:
  - LockN Bot — OpenClaw (Runtime)
  - LockN Chat — Matrix / Slack (Comms)
  - LockN Auth — Zitadel / Auth0 (Identity)
  - LockN Work — Plane / Linear (Work Items)
  - LockN Doc — AFFiNE / Notion (Knowledge)
  - LockN Mem — Qdrant (Vector Memory)
  - LockN Net — Infra Stack
  - LockN Arch — D2 + Mermaid (Diagrams)
  - LockN Flow — Temporal (Orchestration)
- Each module: owned OSS impl + commercial SaaS adapter (provider abstraction pattern)
- Suggested additions: LockN Watch (observability), LockN Voice (TTS/voice)
- Next steps pending Sean's call: Linear initiative structure and/or provider interface design
