 "EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE!" — A space lobster, probably
 
 Any OS gateway for AI agents across WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more.
 
 Send a message, get an agent response from your pocket. Plugins add Mattermost and more.
 
-OpenClaw connects chat apps to coding agents like Pi through a single Gateway process. It powers the OpenClaw assistant and supports local or remote setups.
+## What is OpenClaw?
+
+OpenClaw is a self-hosted gateway that connects your favorite chat apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more — to AI coding agents like Pi. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine (or a server), and it becomes the bridge between your messaging apps and an always-available AI assistant.
+Who is it for? Developers and power users who want a personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.
+What makes it different?
+
+- Self-hosted: runs on your hardware, your rules
+
+- Multi-channel: one Gateway serves WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more simultaneously
+
+- Agent-native: built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, and multi-agent routing
+
+- Open source: MIT licensed, community-driven
+
+What do you need? Node 22+, an API key (Anthropic recommended), and 5 minutes.
