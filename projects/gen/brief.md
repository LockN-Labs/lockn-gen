- ⏳ **LOC-113** — OTEL instrumentation (Backlog)
- ⏳ **LOC-234** — Production hardening (Backlog)
- ⚠️ **LOC-343** — Decision required: ship-or-shelve

## Summary
Gen is currently stalled pending strategic decision-making. Technical readiness is incomplete, and LOC-343 is the gating item for whether to push forward or pause investment.
