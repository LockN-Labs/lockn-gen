# LockN Look — Project Brief

## Status
- **Phase:** discovery
- **Confidence:** 0.30
- **Last Verified:** 2026-02-09

## Overview
LockN Look is the vision module (image understanding and visual reasoning) in the LockN stack. It has infrastructure alignment via Qwen3-VL 8B running on Ollama, but the core vision service implementation remains in backlog.

## Current State (Linear)
- ⏳ **LOC-222** — Vision service (Backlog)
- ✅ Runtime foundation available: **Qwen3-VL 8B on Ollama**

## Summary
Look is still pre-MVP/discovery. The model substrate exists, but application-layer service delivery is pending. Priority is converting model availability into a stable API/service surface.
