# LockN Listen — Project Brief

## Status
- **Phase:** mvp
- **Confidence:** 0.50
- **Last Verified:** 2026-02-09

## Overview
LockN Listen is the speech-to-text ingestion service for the LockN ecosystem. The core MVP is complete, but the FastAPI-based STT service work remains in backlog and is the key gap to close for production-ready service exposure.

## Current State (Linear)
- ✅ **LOC-38** — MVP complete
- ⏳ **LOC-227** — STT FastAPI service (Backlog)
- ⏳ **LOC-241** — STT FastAPI follow-up work (Backlog)

## Summary
Listen has proven core functionality (MVP done), but service packaging/API delivery is unfinished. Near-term execution should prioritize LOC-227 and LOC-241 to convert Listen from “working capability” to “ready service.”
