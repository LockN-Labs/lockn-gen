# LockN Brain — Project Log

## 2026-02-09 — Cognitive Framework Expansion
- **PM Bootstrap completed** with multi-model research (Opus + Codex + Kimi strategy)
- **Architecture expanded:** Brain → Cognition + Memory + Orchestration + Integration layers
- **Memory layer designed:** SQLite (structured/deterministic) + Qdrant (semantic/probabilistic)
- **Storage routing:** System 1 → SQLite only; System 2 → SQLite + Vector
- **Strategic insight:** Brain is THE product — every other module is a peripheral
- **9 new tickets identified** for expanded scope (Cognition, Memory, Orchestration, Integration)
- Notion page created under Technical Architecture
- Research sources: full GitHub codebase analysis, Linear ticket audit, workspace memory, today's architecture conversations

## 2026-02-05 — ARCHITECTURE.md v1.1
- Detailed design document with 4 implementation phases
- Qdrant integration spec with hybrid search
- TTS integration points defined
- Latency targets established

## 2026-02-04 — Context-Aware Routing Decision
- Selected Option C: Coder-Next primary, Opus escalation
- 95% local execution target ($0 cost)
- Architecture decision recorded in MEMORY.md

## 2026-02-02 — Brain Concept Born
- Dual-process architecture inspired by Kahneman
- System 0 (router) + System 1 (fast) + System 2 (slow) defined
- Qdrant selected as vector store
- lockn-brain repo created on GitHub
