# LockN SAFE Investment Strategy Brief
**Prepared: February 10, 2026 | CFO Advisory**

---

## Executive Summary

LockN is at the optimal inflection point for SAFE-based fundraising: pre-revenue with accelerating traction, a clear product-market signal, and a founder who's demonstrated conviction through self-funding. This brief outlines a staged SAFE strategy to raise $100K–$500K while preserving founder equity and positioning for a strong Series A.

## 1. SAFE Structure Recommendation

### Post-Money vs Pre-Money: Use Post-Money SAFEs

**Recommendation: Post-money SAFE (YC standard template)**

- **Industry standard** — 92% of pre-seed rounds use SAFEs (Carta Q3 2025), and post-money with valuation cap only is the dominant structure
- **Clarity** — Post-money SAFEs give you exact dilution visibility. You know precisely what % each investor gets. Pre-money SAFEs create ambiguity because dilution shifts as you raise more
- **Investor familiarity** — Angels and institutional investors expect YC post-money SAFEs. Deviating creates friction and signals inexperience
- **Use the standard YC SAFE docs** from ycombinator.com/documents — don't modify them

### Valuation Cap Range

Based on current market data (Carta 2025):

| Round Size | Median Post-Money Cap (2025) | LockN Recommended Range |
|---|---|---|
| Under $250K | $7.5M | **$5M–$8M** |
| $250K–$500K | $10M–$12M | **$8M–$10M** |
| $500K+ | $15M–$20M | **$10M–$12M** |

**For LockN's initial raise, target a $6M–$8M post-money cap.**

Rationale:
- Pre-revenue proptech/IoT typically commands lower caps than SaaS or AI ($15M–$35M median)
- Hardware-adjacent startups face a "show me" discount vs pure software
- A $6M–$8M cap is attractive to angels (meaningful upside) while not undervaluing the business
- Leaves room to raise a subsequent SAFE at $10M–$15M after hitting revenue milestones

### Discount Rate

**Recommendation: No discount. Cap only.**

- The dominant market standard is cap-only (no discount)
- Adding a discount complicates the instrument and signals desperation
- If an investor insists on a discount, offer 15–20% max as a concession
- Never stack cap + discount — it creates a "double dip"

### Pro-Rata Rights

**Recommendation: Offer pro-rata side letter only to investors writing $25K+**

- Standard YC SAFEs don't include pro-rata by default
- Offering it selectively to larger checks incentivizes bigger investments
- Keep the SAFE clean; use a separate side letter for pro-rata
- This is a meaningful sweetener that costs you nothing today

## 2. Fundraising Angles & Approaches

### A. Friends & Family SAFE Round ($25K–$100K)

**Do this first. Start now.**

- Minimum check: $1,000–$5,000 (keep it accessible)
- Cap: $5M–$6M (reward earliest believers with the best price)
- Target: 5–15 investors from personal network
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks to close
- **Key advantage:** Fast money, no pitch deck required, builds momentum
- **Watch out:** Still must comply with securities law (see Section 4). Use accredited investors where possible; up to 35 non-accredited allowed under Reg D 506(b) but adds disclosure burden

### B. Angel Investor Outreach ($50K–$250K)

**Proptech/IoT-focused angels and groups:**

| Investor/Group | Focus | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MetaProp | NYC proptech VC/angel | Largest proptech-focused VC; active at pre-seed |
| Moderne Ventures | Real estate tech | Venture fund + strategic LP network |
| Camber Creek | Real estate tech | Often invest via SAFE at pre-seed |
| UpHonest Capital | AI/IoT/proptech overlap | Good fit for hardware+software plays |
| Wilshire Lane Capital | Real estate tech | Active pre-seed investor |
| Angel groups: NY Angels, Tech Coast Angels, Golden Seeds | General + proptech interest | Syndicate deals, $25K–$100K checks |

**Outreach strategy:**
- Warm intros > cold outreach (3x higher conversion)
- Lead with the traction story: "exponential growth, self-funded, flywheel turning"
- Target angels who are property managers, real estate operators, or smart home execs — they're both investors and potential customers/advisors

### C. Accelerator/Incubator Pathway

| Program | Investment | Terms | Fit for LockN |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Y Combinator** | $500K | $500K on post-money SAFE (standard deal) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Best brand, but highly competitive |
| **Techstars IoT** (if active) | $120K | $20K + $100K convertible note, 6% equity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — IoT focus is perfect |
| **URBAN-X** | $150K | Pre-seed investment | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Urban tech/proptech focused |
| **Plug and Play Real Estate** | Varies | No equity taken; corporate partner access | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Strategic intros to real estate cos |
| **HAX (SOSV)** | $250K | Hardware-focused accelerator | ⭐⭐⭐ — Good if hardware is significant |

**Recommendation:** Apply to YC (next batch) and URBAN-X simultaneously. Even if rejected, the application process forces pitch refinement. Accelerator investment is additive — you can layer SAFE money on top.

### D. Strategic Investors

These are the highest-leverage investors for LockN:

- **Smart lock companies** — Schlage/Allegion, Yale/ASSA ABLOY, Kwikset/Spectrum Brands (venture arms or corporate dev)
- **Property management platforms** — AppFolio, Buildium, RealPage, Yardi
- **Multifamily REITs** — AvalonBay, Equity Residential, UDR (innovation arms)
- **Smart home ecosystems** — Ring/Amazon, Google Nest partnerships
- **STR platforms** — Airbnb, Vrbo (partnership + investment)

**How to approach:**
- Don't lead with "invest in us" — lead with "partner with us"
- Offer pilot programs that demonstrate value, then convert champions into investors
- Strategic investors typically write $50K–$250K checks at pre-seed via SAFE
- **Caution:** Avoid exclusivity terms or rights that limit future partnerships

### E. Revenue-Based Milestone Triggers for Future SAFEs

Structure your fundraising in tranches tied to traction:

| Milestone | Justifies Cap Of | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Working prototype + first pilots | $5M–$8M | Current stage |
| 10 paying customers or $5K MRR | $8M–$12M | Proof of willingness to pay |
| 50 units deployed, $15K+ MRR | $12M–$18M | Product-market fit signal |
| $50K+ MRR, clear unit economics | $18M–$25M | Series A readiness |

**This creates a natural "raise as you grow" rhythm** — each SAFE tranche is at a higher cap, rewarding earlier investors and reflecting genuine progress.

## 3. Cap Table Modeling — Dilution at Series A Conversion

### Assumptions
- Founder holds 100% pre-investment (10M authorized shares)
- Series A: $3M raised at $20M pre-money valuation ($23M post-money)
- ESOP pool created at Series A: 10%

### Scenario A: Raise $100K via SAFE at $6M Post-Money Cap

| Stakeholder | Post-SAFE Conversion | % Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Founder | — | **74.2%** |
| SAFE Investors ($100K @ $6M cap) | 1.67% of post-money | **1.7%** |
| Series A Investors ($3M @ $23M) | 13.0% | **13.0%** |
| ESOP | 10.0% | **10.0%** |
| **Founder effective** | | **~75.3% pre-ESOP, ~65.3% post-ESOP** |

### Scenario B: Raise $250K via SAFE at $8M Post-Money Cap

| Stakeholder | Post-SAFE Conversion | % Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Founder | — | **69.9%** |
| SAFE Investors ($250K @ $8M cap) | 3.1% | **3.1%** |
| Series A Investors ($3M @ $23M) | 13.0% | **13.0%** |
| ESOP | 10.0% | **10.0%** |
| **Founder effective** | | **~73.9% pre-ESOP, ~63.9% post-ESOP** |

### Scenario C: Raise $500K via SAFEs — Staged Caps

$200K at $6M cap + $300K at $10M cap (reward early investors, raise cap with traction):

| Stakeholder | Post-SAFE Conversion | % Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Founder | — | **66.7%** |
| Early SAFE ($200K @ $6M) | 3.3% | **3.3%** |
| Later SAFE ($300K @ $10M) | 3.0% | **3.0%** |
| Series A Investors ($3M @ $23M) | 13.0% | **13.0%** |
| ESOP | 10.0% | **10.0%** |
| **Founder effective** | | **~70.7% pre-ESOP, ~60.7% post-ESOP** |

### Key Takeaway

Even at $500K raised, founder retains ~61–67% at Series A. **This is healthy.** The staged cap approach limits dilution from later money while rewarding early believers.

## 4. Legal & Compliance Checklist

### Must-Have Before Issuing SAFEs

- [ ] **Delaware C-Corp** — If not already incorporated, form a Delaware C-Corp (standard for VC-backed startups). Cost: ~$500–$1,500 with a service like Stripe Atlas, Clerky, or Firstbase
- [ ] **Board resolution** authorizing SAFE issuance
- [ ] **83(b) election** filed (if founder equity was recently issued — must be within 30 days of grant)
- [ ] **Cap table management** — Set up on Carta, Pulley, or AngelList Stack (free tier available)

### Securities Law Compliance

- [ ] **Regulation D, Rule 506(b)** — Most common exemption for SAFE rounds
  - Unlimited raise amount
  - No general solicitation (no public advertising)
  - Up to 35 non-accredited investors (but ideally stick to accredited only)
  - Self-certification questionnaire is sufficient for accredited verification under 506(b)
- [ ] **Form D filing** with SEC — Required within 15 days of first sale. File electronically on EDGAR. Cost: $0
- [ ] **State blue sky filings** — Most states require notice filing after Form D. Varies by state; typically $50–$300 per state where investors reside
- [ ] **Accredited investor verification** — For 506(b): investor self-certification via questionnaire. For 506(c) (general solicitation): must use third-party verification (tax returns, broker letter, etc.)

### Documents Needed Per Investor

- [ ] Post-money SAFE agreement (YC template)
- [ ] Pro-rata side letter (if applicable)
- [ ] Accredited investor questionnaire
- [ ] Investor information form (name, address, SSN/EIN for tax reporting)

### Recommended Legal Support

- **Budget option:** Clerky ($500–$2,000 for full SAFE package including Form D)
- **Standard:** Startup-focused attorney ($3,000–$7,000 for full round)
- **Top-tier:** Cooley, Goodwin, Gunderson — typically offer deferred billing for funded startups
- **Do NOT skip legal counsel.** A botched securities offering creates liability that can torpedo a Series A.

## 5. Timing Strategy

### Immediate (Now — Feb/Mar 2026): Foundation

- [ ] Ensure Delaware C-Corp is in order
- [ ] Set up cap table on Carta/Pulley
- [ ] Prepare SAFE docs (use YC template via Clerky)
- [ ] Build a concise pitch deck (10 slides max)
- [ ] Identify 10–15 friends & family prospects

### Phase 1 (Mar–Apr 2026): Friends & Family — Target $50K–$100K

- Cap: $5M–$6M post-money
- Close quickly — don't let this drag past 4 weeks
- Use momentum ("we're closing March 31") to create urgency
- File Form D after first close

### Phase 2 (Apr–Jun 2026): Angels + Accelerator Apps — Target $100K–$200K

- Cap: $7M–$8M post-money (higher cap reflects F&F traction)
- Apply to YC S26, URBAN-X, Techstars simultaneously
- Begin warm intro campaign to proptech angels
- Target: 3–5 angel investors writing $25K–$50K checks

### Phase 3 (Jul–Sep 2026): Strategic + Growth SAFE — Target $100K–$200K

- Cap: $10M–$12M post-money (should have early revenue or committed pilots by now)
- Approach property management companies and smart lock industry contacts
- Only if needed — may skip if accelerator provides sufficient runway

### Milestones That Maximize Valuation Cap

| Milestone | Impact on Negotiating Position |
|---|---|
| First paying customer | Moves you from "idea" to "business" — biggest single lever |
| 10 units deployed (even free pilots) | Proves the tech works in the field |
| LOI or partnership with property mgmt co | Validates market demand without revenue |
| $5K MRR | Unlocks $10M+ cap conversations |
| Accelerator acceptance | Instant credibility boost, often 2x cap increase |

### Total Target: $250K–$400K Over 6 Months

This gives 12–18 months of runway (assuming lean burn of $15K–$25K/month), enough to hit Series A milestones.
