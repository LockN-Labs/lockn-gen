You are creating a production-ready OpenClaw skill called `lockn-speak` that can be installed into any OpenClaw instance.

Goal:
- Add a skill that provides LockN Speak TTS capabilities.
- Enforce subscription licensing via API key before any synthesis call.
- If license validation fails, deny usage with a clear upgrade message.

Environment assumptions:
- OpenClaw skill layout uses `SKILL.md` + helper scripts.
- Skill will call LockN Speak API over HTTPS.
- License checks are performed against LockN licensing endpoint.

Required deliverables:
1) Skill directory scaffold:
   - `skills/lockn-speak/SKILL.md`
   - `skills/lockn-speak/README.md`
   - `skills/lockn-speak/scripts/speak.sh`
   - `skills/lockn-speak/scripts/validate-license.sh`
2) Copy-paste installation instructions for a new OpenClaw instance.
3) Example `.env` variables and secure handling guidance.
4) Failure-mode behavior and user-facing error messages.
5) Smoke-test commands.

License gating requirements (mandatory):
- Require `LOCKN_LICENSE_API_KEY` in environment.
- Before any TTS request, call:
  - `POST ${LOCKN_LICENSE_URL:-https://api.lockn.ai/v1/licenses/validate}`
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer $LOCKN_LICENSE_API_KEY`
  - Body must include: feature=`lockn-speak`, instanceId, requestedAction=`tts.generate`
- Only proceed when response indicates active subscription + feature entitlement.
- Cache positive validation for a short TTL (e.g., 5 minutes) to reduce latency.
- Never cache failed validation as success.

LockN Speak invocation requirements:
- Use `LOCKN_SPEAK_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.lockn.ai/v1/speak`).
- Require `LOCKN_SPEAK_API_KEY` for provider authentication.
- Endpoint for generation: `POST $LOCKN_SPEAK_BASE_URL/tts`
- Input contract:
  - text (required)
  - voice/profile id (optional, default from env)
  - style/speed options (optional)
- Output:
  - save audio file locally and print path
  - include concise success metadata (duration, model/voice used)

Security requirements:
- Never print raw API keys.
- Fail fast if required env vars missing.
- Sanitize shell inputs (quote variables, reject empty text).
- Return non-zero exit code on license or API failure.

SKILL.md should include:
- What the skill does
- Inputs to collect
- License requirement note
- Example invocations
- Troubleshooting (401/403/429/network)

Installation section (must be copyable):
- Create skill directory and files
- Export required env vars:
  - LOCKN_LICENSE_API_KEY
  - LOCKN_SPEAK_API_KEY
  - LOCKN_LICENSE_URL (optional)
  - LOCKN_SPEAK_BASE_URL (optional)
  - LOCKN_SPEAK_DEFAULT_PROFILE (optional)
- Restart/reload OpenClaw and run smoke test
