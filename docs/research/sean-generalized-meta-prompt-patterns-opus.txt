Generalized System-Improvement Prompt Patterns (Opus Rewrite)
Derived from Sean directives in Slack history
Compiled: 2026-02-11

---

PATTERN 1 — Ranked Operating Agenda
Template:
"Review current signals across channels/systems and produce a ranked, bucketed execution plan with immediate actions, blockers, and owner handoffs."

Intent:
Force prioritization, reduce context switching, and convert raw signal into actionable sequencing.

---

PATTERN 2 — Anti-Repetition Reliability Contract
Template:
"Design process changes so I never need to repeat the same instruction. Prioritize acknowledgment, continuity memory, and deterministic follow-through."

Intent:
Eliminate instruction loss and brittle execution loops.

---

PATTERN 3 — Self-Healing Control Plane
Template:
"Enable autonomous recovery primitives (restart/retry/health repair) so agent workflows can self-correct without human intervention."

Intent:
Reduce downtime from orchestration failures.

---

PATTERN 4 — Suspected Root-Cause Reframe
Template:
"Assume observed failures may be caused by [specific subsystem hypothesis]. Validate that theory before broad fixes."

Intent:
Prevent shallow patching; enforce root-cause-driven remediation.

---

PATTERN 5 — Dynamic Model Routing Override
Template:
"Reassign unstable or mismatched workloads to a better-fit model and rename workflows to reflect the new routing policy."

Intent:
Keep execution resilient under provider-specific failure modes.

---

PATTERN 6 — Memory Hallucination Guardrail
Template:
"Assume stale indexed memory may persist after correction. Add correction overrides, recency weighting, and live-check precedence for operational facts."

Intent:
Stop historical state from masquerading as current state.

---

PATTERN 7 — Vector Investment Decision Gate
Template:
"Before scaling vector memory, quantify expected retrieval gain, maintenance overhead, and current-file-scale sufficiency. Invest only if net operational leverage is clear."

Intent:
Avoid premature infra complexity.

---

PATTERN 8 — Observability as Product Primitive
Template:
"Build real-time visibility for model usage, token flow, caps proximity, and system health; package it as an internal control surface and eventual product capability."

Intent:
Turn ops telemetry into strategic and product value.

---

PATTERN 9 — Projectization Trigger
Template:
"When a capability crosses strategic importance, escalate from ad-hoc tasks to formal project kickoff with milestones, tickets, and stakeholder review."

Intent:
Move from reactive execution to coordinated delivery.

---

PATTERN 10 — Always-On Mission Control UX
Template:
"Design a persistent operator dashboard: open threads, system focus, active work, critical blockers, and next priorities at a glance for all-day monitoring."

Intent:
Compress decision latency for executive oversight.

---

PATTERN 11 — Process Hardening Loop
Template:
"Treat each recurring issue as a process bug. Harden workflow until failure is difficult to reproduce."

Intent:
Institutionalize continuous improvement from incidents.

---

PATTERN 12 — Quality Gate Before Handoff
Template:
"Enforce a mandatory visual quality gate with explicit threshold(s) before implementation handoff. Iterate until pass."

Instantiated example:
- Composite VL score must be > 9.81 / 10.00.

Intent:
Prevent low-quality design debt from entering build queues.

---

PATTERN 13 — Fallback Compute Policy
Template:
"If preferred model path fails, immediately fail over to approved local alternative and continue the loop without blocking."

Intent:
Keep iteration velocity under cloud/provider instability.

---

PATTERN 14 — Agent-Actionable Work Doctrine
Template:
"Assume all work is agent-executable by default. Remove ‘manual’ buckets; only escalate true human decisions to a dedicated approvals channel."

Intent:
Prevent idle queue states and ambiguous ownership.

---

PATTERN 15 — Two-Level Priority Scheduler
Template:
"Operationalize L1 project-priority queue + L2 issue-priority queue. Pull from top of both, execute in that order, and enforce continuously."

Intent:
Align execution with strategic priority ordering.

---

PATTERN 16 — Parallelism with Conflict Controls
Template:
"Run parallel work across top priorities when non-conflicting; serialize only dependency/file/domain conflicts."

Intent:
Maximize throughput without inducing rework collisions.

---

PATTERN 17 — Scheduler Cadence Coupling
Template:
"Align dispatcher cadence with worker spawn cadence; stagger dispatcher offset to avoid race conditions."

Instantiated example:
- Worker: :00/:10/:20/:30/:40/:50
- Dispatcher: :05/:15/:25/:35/:45/:55

Intent:
Ensure deterministic dispatch and low reaction latency.

---

PATTERN 18 — Operationalization Bias
Template:
"If a strategy is approved, convert immediately into live ops artifacts: ticket, schedule, labels, guards, escalation path, and status telemetry."

Intent:
Close gap between agreement and execution.

---

PATTERN 19 — Communication Ordering Requirement
Template:
"Provide short progress updates if needed, but preserve strict message order and coherence."

Intent:
Maintain trust during active investigation loops.

---

PATTERN 20 — Evidence-Seeking Follow-up Prompt
Template:
"Identify the failing component precisely (job, run, subsystem), then report exact failure target before proposing correction."

Intent:
Avoid vague remediation and improve debugging precision.

---

Reusable Meta-Prompt (Combined)

"Act as an execution systems architect. Convert strategic directives into hardened operations by: (1) ranking work into immediate/near-term/structural buckets, (2) enforcing explicit quality and decision gates, (3) routing all tasks as agent-actionable unless human judgment is strictly required, (4) scheduling with conflict-aware parallelism using project→issue priority queues, (5) instrumenting observability and failure detection, (6) integrating correction-memory safeguards against stale retrieval, and (7) returning concrete operational artifacts (tickets, cron schedules, guardrails, and escalation channels). Prefer resilient, testable workflows over ad-hoc fixes."
