# Integrations

Documentation for our operating processes with external systems.

## Pages

- [GitHub](./github.md) — Repository management, PR workflow, CI/CD
- [Linear](./linear.md) — Issue tracking, ticket lifecycle, labels
- [Notion](./notion.md) — Documentation sync, knowledge base

## Principles

1. **Automation first** — Agents handle routine operations
2. **Audit trail** — All changes are documented and traceable
3. **Process = observability** — The workflow itself provides visibility
4. **Human escalation** — Strategic decisions go to Sean
